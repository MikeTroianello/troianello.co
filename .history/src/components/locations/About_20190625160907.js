        I have been a mascot for for a professional baseball team, I have
        performed with the Band Kansas, and I recorded an album of my own songs.
        After working as a teacher,a bartender, and a clerk of three different
        company departments, I found myself continually drawn to coding and web
        development. In 2018, after having the means of following this
        inclination, I moved to Miami, FL to study Full Stack Web Development at
        Ironhack.
